In April 2025, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth faced intense scrutiny after reports emerged that he had shared sensitive military information via the encrypted messaging app Signal. The controversy began when it was revealed that Hegseth had disseminated details about planned airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen to a Signal group chat that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer—individuals without the necessary security clearances citeturn0news17.

This incident followed a prior breach in March, where Hegseth and other senior officials, including Vice President JD Vance and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, used Signal to coordinate military operations. In that case, a journalist was inadvertently added to the chat, leading to the public disclosure of operational details citeturn0search40.

The revelations have prompted bipartisan concern. Democratic leaders, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have called for Hegseth's resignation, labeling the leaks as significant breaches of national security citeturn0search11. Some Republicans have also expressed unease, with Representative Don Bacon criticizing the use of unsecured communication channels for sensitive information citeturn0search40.

Despite the backlash, the White House has stood by Hegseth, asserting confidence in his leadership and downplaying the severity of the leaks citeturn0search6. Hegseth himself has dismissed the reports as "anonymous smears" from disgruntled former employees citeturn0search13.

The Pentagon's inspector general has launched an investigation into the matter, focusing on the potential mishandling of classified information and the implications for operational security. As the inquiry unfolds, the incident has reignited debates over the use of personal communication apps for official government business and the protocols surrounding the sharing of sensitive information.

The outcome of this investigation could have significant ramifications for Hegseth's tenure and the broader practices within the Department of Defense.
