## 🧪 The Science Behind the Torpedo Bat
The torpedo bat, also dubbed the "bowling pin bat," deviates from the conventional bat design by redistributing mass closer to the barrel's centerThis design aligns the bat's heft with the typical contact point, optimizing energy transfer upon impactThe result is a bat that feels lighter during the swing but delivers more power when connecting with the ball
Aaron Leanhardt, a former MIT physicist and current field coordinator for the Miami Marlins, pioneered this designHis academic background in physics and experience in baseball coaching converged to create a bat that leverages scientific principles to enhance hitting performanceLeanhardt's approach involved analyzing players' swing data to identify common contact points and adjusting the bat's mass distribution accordingly citeturn0search12
