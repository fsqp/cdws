James "Murr" Murray, a member of the comedy troupe The Tenderloins and star of *Impractical Jokers*, is under scrutiny following allegations of inappropriate interactions with a minor.

## Allegations Surface

In March 2025, a Reddit user accused Murray of exchanging inappropriate messages with her between 2012 and 2013, when she was 16 and he was 35. The user, identifying herself as Melyssa, claimed that Murray made suggestive comments, provided gifts, and arranged meetings during his tours in London and New York. She alleged that during these encounters, she was given alcohol and stayed in his hotel room. Screenshots of their conversations, including messages where Murray reportedly said, "Once you turn 18, email me the same question and I’ll be happy to answer," were shared but have since been removed from Reddit. citeturn0search4
